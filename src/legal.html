                    <h3>About these Terms</h3>
                    <p>
                        We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service at any time. You should review these terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable
                        Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective
                        immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue your use of that Service. If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional
                        terms will control for that conflict. These terms control the relationship between Blnq and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights. If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away,
                        this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The laws of the United
                        Kingdom, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, will apply to these terms any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will
                        be litigated exclusively in the courts of the United Kingdom and you and Blnq consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. A printed version of these terms shall be admissible in legal, judicial, civil or administrative proceedings
                        based on or relating to these terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. These terms, together with any Additional Terms,
                        constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and us with respect to the
                        Services.
