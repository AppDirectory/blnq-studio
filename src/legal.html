                            You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us and our
                            officers, directors, members, managers, employees,

                            of, based on, or in connection with your access to

                        <h3>Business uses of our Services</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you are using our Services on behalf of a company
                            or other organization, that company or other
                            organization will be bound by these terms, and you
                            hereby warrant and represent that you are authorized
                            to accept and agree to these terms on behalf of such
                            company or other organization.
                        </p>

                        <h3>About these Terms</h3>
                        <p>
                            We may modify these terms or any additional terms
                            that apply to a Service at any time. You should
                            review these terms regularly. We’ll post notice of
                            modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll
                            post notice of modified additional terms in the
                            applicable Service. Changes will not apply
                            retroactively and will become effective no sooner
                            than fourteen days after they are posted. However,
                            changes addressing new functions for a Service or
                            changes made for legal reasons will be effective
                            immediately. If you do not agree to the modified
                            terms for a Service, your sole and exclusive remedy
                            is to discontinue your use of that Service. If there
                            is a conflict between these terms and the additional
                            terms, the additional terms will control for that
                            conflict. These terms control the relationship
                            between Blnq and you. They do not create any third
                            party beneficiary rights. If you do not comply with
                            these terms, and we don’t take action right away,
                            this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights
                            that we may have (such as taking action in the
                            future). If it turns out that a particular term is
                            not enforceable, this will not affect any other
                            terms. The laws of the United Kingdom, without
                            regard to its conflict of laws rules, will apply to
                            these terms any disputes arising out of or relating
                            to these terms or the Services. All claims arising
                            out of or relating to these terms or the Services
                            will be litigated exclusively in the courts of the
                            United Kingdom and you and Blnq consent to personal
                            jurisdiction in those courts. A printed version of
                            these terms shall be admissible in legal, judicial,
                            civil or administrative proceedings based on or
                            relating to these terms to the same extent and
                            subject to the same conditions as other business
                            documents and records originally generated and
                            maintained in printed form. These terms, together
                            with any Additional Terms, constitute the entire
                            agreement between you and us with respect to the
                            Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous
                            communications and proposals, whether electronic,
                            oral or written, between you and us with respect to
                            the Services.
